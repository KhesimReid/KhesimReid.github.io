          I am a final year student at the University of Manchester, pursuing
          the BSc(Hons) Computer Science course. My technical interests lie
          mainly in artificial intelligence, distributed systems and software
          engineering; and I hope to one day be able to use my technical skills
          to help enhance the lives of others.

              <p>
                Martial Arts have been a big part of my life for a number of
                years, starting from when I first began training in ITF
                Taekwon-Do at about seven years old. In my twelve years of
                training, I climbed the ranks to 2nd Dan (2nd Degree Black Belt)
                and travelled to Las Vegas for an International Instructors
                Course, where I had the opportunity to train with practitioners
                from around the world, under the tutilage of Masters and Grand
                Masters. In my time at university, I sometimes attend Jiu Jitsu
                and Kick Boxing sessions at the UoM MMA Society.

              <!-- Music info -->
              <p>
                As a so called 'Music Junkie', I have often enjoyed both playing
                and listening to various forms of music. I was a member of the
                ALHCS Steel Orchestra, as a Lead Pan Player, and the Concert
                Band, as First Clarinet, for most of my high school career. I
                also completed the CSEC Music examination and managed to place
                2nd in the entire Caribbean region. I have also done a bit of
                musical composition and arranging, as well as piano playing.

              <!-- Reading info -->
              <p>
                Even in this digital age, I still love to read books when I have
                the time. My favourite genres include fantasy novels like 'Harry
                Potter'; dystopian fiction such as 'The Hunger Games',
                'Divergent' and 'Legend'; and graphic novels of Japanese origin,
                known as Manga. I also enjoy reading in order to enhance my
                knowledge base and personal development in areas unrelated to my
                studies. I've found books such as 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad'; Peter
                Thiel's 'Zero to One'; and John C. Maxwell's 'Irrefutable Laws
                of Leadership' to be worthwhile reads for young adults with big
                dreams.
